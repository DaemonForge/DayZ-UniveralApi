# DayZ Universal Api
 
 the Universal Api Mod and Webservice this is my attempt to make a Universal Api Backend for the server hosters, allowing for a robust, easy to use and set up backend. and for modders an easy to use API wrapper to help them make hived and cross-server mods more easily. With the mod and API I handle authentication and client tokens allowing you to ensure that the data you are accessing and using is secured, preventing rouge and unwanted access to the APIs.
